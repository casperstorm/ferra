# Ferra for Kitty
This ports Ferra to [Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)

## Installing manually
You can download and put the `ferra.conf` file into your Kitty's config's directory
and then import it in your config:
```conf
include ferra.conf
```

Alternatively you can copy the contents of `ferra.conf` into your config directly.
